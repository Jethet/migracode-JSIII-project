- terminal is often called 'shell'
- it is an application that you can use, just like any application (Word, calculator, browser)
- a terminal can be 'bash' or 'zsh': these are terminal types but they do the same
- you cannot use the mouse in the terminal: only the arrow keys
- you can run the same command again by using the arrow UP or arrow DOWN keys

useful commands:

pwd     = present working directory: it gives you the folder you are working in
~       = go to home directory (~ = home)
cd      = go to home directory
cd NAME = go to folder/directory NAME

ls      = show list of files in folder/directory
clear   = clears everything in the terminal

mkdir NAME = make new directory/folder with the name of NAME
touch NAME = make a new file with the name of NAME

cp NAME    = copy file NAME
cp NAME FOLDER = copy the file NAME into the folder FOLDER

mv FILELOCATION/NAME FILELOCATION/NAME  = move NAME from one location to a new location
mv NAME NEWNAME = rename the file NAME to NEWNAME

rm NAME    = remove (delete) file NAME


Ctrl C  will terminate most of the commands that are running


==>  commands that start with sudo have to do with administrator privileges, don't use them
     unless you are sure of what you are doing! (sudo = SuperUserDo, superuser is the admin)
