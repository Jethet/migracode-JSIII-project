        SYNOPSIS
      </h3>
      Breaking Bad is an American neo-Western crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. The
      show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008 to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a total of 62
      episodes. It was set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and tells the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston),
      an underemployed and depressed high school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of
      stage-three lung cancer. White turns to crime, partnering with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), by
      producing and selling crystallized methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while
      navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. The title is a Southern colloquialism meaning to turn to a life
      of crime. Gilligan characterized the series as showing Walter's transformation from a soft-spoken Mr. Chips into
      Scarface.
      Among the show's co-stars are Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte as Walter's wife Skyler and son Walter, Jr., and Betsy Brandt
      and Dean Norris as Skyler's sister Marie Schrader and her husband Hank, a DEA agent. Others include Bob Odenkirk
      as White and Pinkman's sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman, Jonathan Banks as private investigator and fixer Mike
      Ehrmantraut, and Giancarlo Esposito as drug kingpin Gus Fring. The final season introduces Jesse Plemons as the
      criminally ambitious Todd Alquist, and Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a business executive secretly
      managing Walter's global meth sales for her company.
      Breaking Bad is widely regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time. It had moderate viewership
      in its first three seasons, but the fourth and fifth seasons saw a significant rise in viewership when it was made
      available on Netflix just before the fourth season premiere. By the time that the series finale aired, it was
      among the most-watched cable shows on American television.
